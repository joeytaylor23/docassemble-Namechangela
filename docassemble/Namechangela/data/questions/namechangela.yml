  C. If the person desiring such change is a minor or if the parents or parent or the tutor of the minor desire to change the name of the minor:
  (1) The petition shall be signed by the father and mother of the minor or by the survivor in case one of them be dead.
  (2) If one parent has been granted custody of the minor by a court of competent jurisdiction, the consent of the other parent is not necessary if the other parent has been served with a copy of the petition and any of the following exists:
  (a) The other parent has refused or failed to comply with a court order of support for a period of one year.
  (b) The other parent has failed to support the child for a period of three years after judgment awarding custody to the parent signing the petition.
